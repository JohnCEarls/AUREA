					<h2>AUREA - GUI User Documentation</h2>

<p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
        <div id="overview">
        <p>
        The AUREA GUI is designed to allow researchers to quickly and easily use Relative Expression based learning algorithms in their own work.
        It provides an intuitive interface to the AUREA libraries allowing biologists and other non-technical researchers to perform expression analysis on a wide variety of platforms and data.
        </p>
        <p>

        The primary navigation between screens is on the left hand side of the screen.  If a button is grayed out, that means that the requirements for that page have not been fulfilled (e.g. you can't define classes if you have no data imported). 
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="datasummary">
        <h3>Data Summary Screen</h3>
        <a class="textlink"  href="/images/AUREA-data-summary.png" align="right"><img src="/images/AUREA-data-summary-200px.png" align="right" class="screenshot"></a>
            <p>The <strong>Data Summary</strong> screen (accessible through the <em>Home</em> button on all screens) provides an overview of the current state of your AUREA session.  As you add data files, partition your classes, train your learners, etc., you can return to the Data Summary screen to review your selected options and the results of your actions.
        </p>

        <p>
        The <em>Data File</em> field informs you which files are currently imported into AUREA and statistical information about how many genes and probes are available from these data sources.  If you are using multiple data file inputs, AUREA will attempt to merge these files, which may result in loss of probe information if their is no mapping between the probeset of one data input to another.
    </p>
        <p>
        The <em>Gene Network File</em> field tells you whether you have imported gene network information and, if so, how many networks can be created from your data, and the size of those networks.  You are required to import a gene network file if you want to use DiRaC or Adaptive Learning.
        </p>
        <p>The <em>Classes</em> field allows you to review your training set information by displaying the size and labels provided during the class definition.  </p>

        
        <p>
        Under the <em>Best Classifiers</em> field you can review the apparent accuracy of any trained learners.  It will display the message "Not trained" when there is currently no trained classifier of that type.  When a classifier has been trained, a tuple showing (the true class 1, false class one, true class 2, false class 2 and the Matthew's Correlation Coefficient) how effectively the learner describes the learning set.  The associated <em>More info...</em> will pop up a window that will give a more detailed explanation of the result of the training of the classification algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
        Under the <em>CV Performance</em> field you will find displayed the Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of the k-fold cross validation from <em>Evaluate Performance</em> screen, if it has been run.
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <div id="importdata">
        <h3>Import Data Screen</h3>
        <a class="textlink"  href="/images/AUREA-import-data.png" align="right"><img src="/images/AUREA-import-data-200px.png" align="right" class="screenshot"></a>
            <p>The <strong>Import Data</strong> screen (accessible through the <em>Import Data</em> button on all screens) is where you tell AUREA where to pull the data from which it will develop it's models.  After you have selected your datasources, you need to click the <em>Import Files</em> button on the bottom right of the screen to make those files available to AUREA.</p>

            <p>
            The <em>Data File</em> field allows you to choose the gene expression datasources that you wish to learn on.  AUREA currently supports csv and SOFT file formats.  See the <a class="textlink"  href="AUREA/faq.html">faq</a> for more information on these data formats.
            If you already have a supported data set you would like to import, you can click <em>Browse ...</em> and navigate to where that dataset is located on your local machine.  If you wish to include multiple files, you can click the <em>Add another file</em> button and another <em>Data File</em> field input box will be displayed.
            When multiple files are being added, you will see a <em>Remove</em> button to the right of the <em>Browse ...</em> button that will allow you to deselect a file from your dataset. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The <em>Download ...</em> button allows you to enter the number of a GDS SOFT file from the <a class="textlink"  href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus</a> and have it downloaded to your data folder.  
                See the <a class="textlink"  href="AUREA/faq.html">faq</a> for more information about how AUREA uses the Gene Expression Omnibus.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <em>Gene Network File</em> field allows you to define the gene networks for use by DiRaC (and by extension, Adaptive).
            You can import data without choosing this field, but you will not be able to run DiRaC or Adaptive without it.
            You will find the default gene network file(c2.biocarta.v2.5.symbols.gmt) in the data folder underneath your workspace. See the <a class="textlink"  href="AUREA/faq.html">faq</a> for more information on available gene network files.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <em>Gene Synonym File</em> field provides gene synonyms that improve the mapping to Gene Networks.  This field is not required, but we recommend that when using DiRaC you also use this field.  We provide a default synonym file (Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz) in the data folder underneath your workspace.
            See the <a class="textlink"  href="AUREA/faq.html">faq</a> for more information on available gene synonym files (non-human for example).
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Data Settings</em> button pops up a window with options related to how your data import is handled.
The Data settings allow you to tell AHREA how you want your data import processed.
The <em>Data Folder</em> entry describes where AHREA should look for the data you
are looking to process and where it should put any generated or downloaded files 
(by default this is the data folder in your workspace).
You may enter an absolute or relative path to the data files.
The Bad Data Value setting is the numeric value that AHREA should use when
parsing data files and it encounters non-numeric values (i.e. `nil').
The <em>Gene Collision Rule</em> setting is the method to be used to
combine/filter different probes within a sample that map to the same gene.
This is used by AHREA to map genes to gene networks.
You have the options `MAX', `AVE' and `MIN' which represent
taking the maximum value, the average value or the minimum value, respectively.
The <em>Gene Column</em> setting is the column title
in data files that corresponds to the gene name column.
The <em>Probe Column</em> is the column title in data files that
corresponds to the probe identifier column.
Both the <em>Gene Column</em> and the <em>Probe Column</em> are initially
set to the values expected in a GEO SOFT file.
If you have a data set where there are only genes or probes available,
set the Gene Column and Probe Column to be equal to the single valid identifying column.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div id="classdefinition" style="clear: both;">
        <h3>Class Definition Screen</h3>
        <a class="textlink"  href="/images/AUREA-class-definition.png" align="right"><img src="/images/AUREA-class-definition-200px.png" align="right" class="screenshot"></a>
            <p>
            The <strong>Class Definition</strong> screen (accessible through the <em>Class Definition</em> button on all screens, provided data has been imported) is where you partition your imported samples into learning sets.
            After you have labeled and partitioned your samples, you need to click the <em>Define Classes</em> button at the bottom of the screen to save your choices.
            </p>

            <p>
            The <em>Class 1</em> and <em>Class 2</em> fields allow you to assign appropriate labels to your training sets.  You are required to enter labels before you can move save your partitioning.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to partition your data set, you select a sample and click the arrow(&gt;&lt;) that will put it in the Box under the class label you want the sample to belong to.
                If you are using SOFT file formatted data sets, you will find <em>*ss</em> in the <em>Select Training Set</em> box.
                SOFT files often contain subsets, and if on import AUREA recognizes that there are subsets available, it will create a label for this subset and you may move the whole subset at once as if it was a single sample.
                For all samples, if AUREA finds descriptive information associated with the sample, it will display it in the box underneath the partitioning boxes.
                Note this is only available with SOFT files.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you have chosen your training set, and provided appropriate labels, click the <em>Define Classes</em> button to save your selections.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="trainclassifiers">
            <h3>Train Classifiers Screen</h3>
            <a class="textlink"  href="/images/AUREA-train-classifiers.png" align="right"><img src="/images/AUREA-train-classifiers-200px.png" align="right" class="screenshot"></a>

            <p>
                The <strong>Train Classifiers</strong> screen (accessible through the <em>Train Classifiers</em> button on all screens, provided the class definition has been set) is where you can select the models wish to train.
                Only models for which the required data is available will have active buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may choose to individually run one of the learning algorithms or to let the Adaptive Trainer learn the best model for the data set. 
                When you select any of the individual algorithms for training, after the model is trained based on the settings for that model, 
                AHREA will display the features that will be used by the model for classification. 
                Various related information is available which can be saved as a text file by clicking save in the window displaying the results.
                In general, this information will include the associated probability matrices, the learner settings, the rules used to determine classification, etc.
            </p>
            <p>

                To run the Adaptive Trainer you should enter a <em>Maximum Time</em> in seconds for the Adaptive learner and a <em>Target accuracy</em>(MCC linearly mapped to [0.0,1.0]) in cross validation. The Adaptive Trainer will display its progress in the status. When the results are displayed you can save the history of the Adaptive Learner as a text file for future use.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <strong>Test Classifiers</strong> screen (accessible through the <em>Test Classifiers</em> button on all screens, provided at least one learner has been trained) allow you to select untrained upon samples and run the trained models against them.
                You can partition a subset of the untrained samples(just like in the class definition) and select a learning algorithm to run against them. 
                A summary of the results will be displayed in a popup window.  
                From this popup window you can save the results to a text file (the text file will give you a sample by sample description of the results).</p>

        </div> 
        <div id="evaluateperformance" style="clear: both;">

        <p>The <strong>Evaluate Performance</strong> screen (accessible through the <em>Test Classifiers</em> button on all screens, provided classes are defined) allows you to run k-fold cross-validation against any learning algorithm that has the data necessary to run.  Learning algorithms that do not have enough data available, will have inactive buttons.  A popup window presents the results of the k-fold cross-validation and reports those results as a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient.  You can review these results in the <em>Data Summary</em> page under CV performance.
        </p>
</div>
        <div id="learnersettings" style="clear: both;">

        <h3>Learner Settings</h3>
        <p>
        The <em>Learner Settings</em> screen (accessible at all times on all screens through the <em>Learner Settings</em> button) contains buttons that will pop up windows allowing you to change the settings of the various learning algorithms.  You can save your settings as an xml file for loading in another session(through the <u>F</u>ile dialog).  By default AUREA will read the initial configuration from the config.xml file stored in the data directory in your workspace.
        </p>
        <!--l. 455--><p>The DiRaC settings control the operation of the stand-alone DiRaC learning algorithm. The 

<em>Row Key </em>setting tells
AHREA whether to use the probe mapping or gene mapping with the learning algorithm. This value should be set
to either ‘gene’ or ‘probe’. For DiRaC this value should be set to ‘gene’ in order to facilitate the mapping of genes to
gene network. The 
<em>Number of Top Networks </em>setting tells DiRaC how many networks should be used in classification.
The 
<em>Minimum Network Size </em>setting tells DiRaC how large a network should be in order to be considered a
candidate for use as a classifier.
<!--l. 467--></p><p>The TSP settings control the operation of the stand-alone TSP algorithm. The 
<em>Row Key </em>setting tells AHREA
whether to use the probe mapping or gene mapping with the learning algorithm. This value should be set to either
‘gene’ or ‘probe’. In general, with TSP you will want to set this value to ‘probe’, but sometimes after
merging data sets you may find that you do not have a good probe mapping, but there is a good
gene mapping, you may choose to run the algorithm using gene names instead of probe names. The

<em>Filters </em>setting lets you define how many genes/probes you wish to train on (see Wilcoxon for the
details).
<!--l. 475--></p><p>The k-TSP settings control the operation of the stand-alone k-TSP algorithm. The 
<em>Row Key </em>setting for k-TSP
operates the same as the Row Key setting for TSP. The 
<em>Maximum K Value </em>setting lets you set the number of
possible pairs you wish to examine. The 
<em>Remove for Cross Validation </em>setting lets you set how many samples should
be removed when k-TSP performs cross validation to determine the optimal k value. The 

<em>Number of Cross</em> 

<em>Validation Runs </em>setting lets you choose how many times you want to perform its internal cross validation when
finding the optimal k value. The 
<em>Filters </em>setting performs the same function as it does in TSP. Note that k-TSP
requires a minimum filter size of at least 2k. You cannot have k disjoint gene pairs without at least 2k genes from
which to choose.
 
<!--l. 482--></p><p>The TST settings control the operation of the stand-alone TST algorithm. The 
<em>Row Key </em>setting performs the same
function as it does in TSP. The 
<em>Filters </em>setting performs the same function as it does in TSP, except with three
filters instead of two.
<!--l. 486--></p><p>The Adaptive settings allow you to set the parameters for the Adaptive model building algorithm. Each learning
algorithm has the same set of settings as found in the stand-alone learning algorithm, but these are defined as
ranges instead of scalar values. The ranged settings follow the format ‘from, to, by.’ For example, if you want the
adaptive algorithm to explore the model space of TSP with first gene filter ranging from 10 to 100 by 10 (i.e.
10,20,30 ... 80, 90) you would put 10 in the first column on TSP-Filter 1 Range, 100 in the second column and 10 in
the third column.
<!--l. 498--></p><p>In addition to the model settings, you should also choose a 
<em>Wilcoxon Row Key </em>which is used to determine whether
to use the probe mapping or gene mapping when generating filter sizes and estimating running times. Your choice
here involves the same considerations as for TSP (i.e. generally it should be ‘probe’ but a poor probe
mapping on a data merge means the user might want to set it to ‘gene’). The 
<em>Initial Weight </em>setting
allows you to increase or decrease the likelihood of a model being run. By default these are set to 1.0.
For example, if you wanted DiRaC to be less often you could set the initial weight of DiRaC to a
number less than one, or conversely if you wanted to increase the frequency with which DiRaC is run,
ass="cmti-10"&gt;ou could increase this factor to be greater than 1. The 

<em>Minimum Weight </em>setting is used internally
to normalize the weight vector in order to prevent underflows (you will rarely need to change this
setting).
