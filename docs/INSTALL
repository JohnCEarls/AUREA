Requirements for Linux
----------------------
tkInter - for the GUI
At least under Ubuntu, python does not by default ship with tkInter.
Instructions for checking your system and installing tkInter if necessary are available at http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter.

Under Ubuntu you can install tkinter using:
>sudo apt-get install python-tk


Install under Windows
---------------------


After you have fulfilled the requirements, you will want to make sure that Python is added to your system path. (see http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html)

In short you can add the location of Python to the system path by right-clicking on My Computer, selecting "Properties", then clicking "Advanced" in the resulting window and selecting Environmental variables.  You can then create a new variable called PYTHONPATH and set its value to the location of Python ("C:/Python2x" by default)

You can then download the appropriate AHREA installation package for your system.

The files are located at #TODO
64-bit Windows w/ python 2.6
    AHREA-1.x.x.win-amd64-py2.6.exe 
For 32-bit python 2.6
    #TODO
64-bit Windows w/ python 2.7
    AHREA-1.x.x.win-amd64-py2.7.exe
For 32-bit python 2.6
    #TODO

Click the .exe file and the install script should handle the rest.

To get started go to your python directory and go to Scripts/.

Click on AHREAGUI.py
