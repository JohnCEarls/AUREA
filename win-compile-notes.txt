#For now I have added a pythonpath to the build.

Move data (need to add data to the setup file the config.xml file needs to be available) #at the moment it appears that the data files are being put in the directory where the script is run from.  This may not be optimum.

python setup.py bdist_wininst

Gave up trying to get 32 bit to compile on 64bit.

On 32bit
Installed Python 2.7 (note that it asks whether to install tcltk)
Added python to path

Installed VS 2008(opened once to allow VS to update paths)
Installed Git
Downloaded swig
Added swig to path(need all of swig files, not just executable)
added PYTHON_INCLUDE and PYTHON_LIB to user variables

Created ssh-key in git bash.

cloned AUREA from github

ran python setup.py build
worked first time (wtf)

ran python setup.py bdist_egg
ran python setup.py bdist
ran python setup.py bdist_wininst

Installed python26 (www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/)
Changed Path, Python_lib and Python_include

ran python setup.py bdist_egg
ran python setup.py bdist
ran python setup.py bdist_wininst

On 64 bit

Installed Python 2.7 (note that it asks whether to install tcltk)

Installed Git
Downloaded swig
Added swig to path(need all of swig files, not just executable)

Created ssh-key in git bash.

cloned AUREA from github
Installed portions of msdn library for VS 2008

Without running VS2008, get that vcvarsall error
-2008 does not install x64 compilers. had to expand C++ tools and select it.
