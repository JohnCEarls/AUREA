AUREA - Adaptive Unified Relative Expression Analyser
=====================================================

AUREA is a python based framework for using Relative Expression Analysis tools on transcriptomic data.
Currently it can read SOFT (Simple Omnibus Format) files and csv files.  
SOFT files are the preferred format of AUREA and the preferred format of GEO.

See the INSTALL instructions to see how to install AUREA on your system.

A GUI is provided to make using these algorithms simpler.
In order to use the GUI you need to download workplace.zip from http://www.igb.uiuc.edu/labs/price/downloads_tmp.html or if you have the source distribution, the 'workplace' folder is underneath the root.  Simply copy the folder to the location you would like to work from.

AUREA is released under the GPL v.3 Affero license, so feel free to adapt AUREA to your needs.
A copy of the AGPL is provided in COPYING.

AUREA uses C code from the RXA project at https://jshare.johnshopkins.edu/dnaiman1/public_html/rxa/ which contains R-based implementations of TSP and TST.  
We encourage you to check out their versions if they fit your needs better.
They are released under GPL v.2.
